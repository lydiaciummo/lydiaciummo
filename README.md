- 👋 Hi, I’m Lydia Ciummo! I am a graduate of the UW Fintech Boot Camp with the goal of becoming a data analyst or data engineer. I am committed to continuously learning and improving so that I can be a valuable asset to future employers. I am new to tech, coming from a background in the beauty and service industry, and am currently seeking my first tech role.
- 👀 I’m interested in making large datasets accessible and easy to interpret so that people and businesses can make smarter financial decisions. Outside of tech, I enjoy videogames, anything outdoors, and spending quality time with my husband, friends, and pets 🐈 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on deepening my understanding of SQL and relational daabases
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage data to enhance people's lives
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached by email at lydiaciummo@hotmail.com or by phone (call or text are both fine) at +1-206-234-7501
